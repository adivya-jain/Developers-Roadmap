# What is FrameWork? # 

A framework is a pre-built set of libraries, tools, and structures that provide a standardized way of developing a particular type of application. 

## Whats the purpose of using it? ##
The purpose of using a framework is to provide a starting point and a set of guidelines for the development process, making it easier and faster to build complex applications.

In the case of "JavaScript" , there are several popular frameworks that are widely used for developing web applications:
1)React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed and maintained by Facebook.
2)Angular: A full-featured framework for building web applications, developed and maintained by Google.
3)Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, developed by Evan You and a community of independent developers.
4)Ember.js: A framework for building ambitious web applications, developed by a community of contributors led by the Ember.js Core Team.
5)Backbone.js: A lightweight and minimalistic framework for building web applications, developed by Jeremy Ashkenas.

Each of these frameworks has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which to use will depend on the specific requirements of the project.
